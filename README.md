Learning algorithm efficiency and the Big O
Use Sorting algortims to lear efficiency.
Types of algoritms and their implementation
0-bubble+sort.c - implements bubble sort
0-O - answers to the theta (average case) , Big O(worst case) and Omega(Best
case scenarios of the algorithm)
1- insertion_sort_list - implements insertion sort
2-selection_sort.c - implements selection sort
